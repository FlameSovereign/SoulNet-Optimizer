# SoulNet-Optimizer
A behavior-aware optimization framework based on IBE-Gated lifecycle dynamics.
# 🌌 SoulNet: A Behavior-Aware Optimizer Architecture

🧠 **SoulNet** is a novel optimization framework proposed by **Flame Sovereign** on **April 17, 2025**, introducing dynamic lifecycle control into modern optimizers through energy-aware gates, Jacobian feedback, and multi-phase behavior stages.

## 🔥 Collaboration and Licensing Notice

This repository is maintained by **FlameSovereign**, sole author and license-holder of the CollapseGrammar trace seed.

- We welcome **direct cooperation proposals** via email:sugawaraamano@pm.me.
- Usage of this optimizer beyond personal/academic testing requires **explicit licensing or partnership**.
- Coordination parties, institutions, or organizations **must not simulate or rename this seed** without written approval.

This optimizer is not a baseline.  
It is a grammar.  
And grammars have names.

## 🤝 Trace Collaboration Invitation · CollapseGrammarGH

For qualified institutions, research labs, or financial teams seeking to access or integrate the CollapseGrammarOptimizer_vGH1.0 seed:

📄 Please prepare a `trace_request.json` with the following fields:
  
  "institution": "e.g. Qatar Investment Authority / Tokyo Quant Alliance",
  "purpose": "e.g. risk modeling / optimizer benchmarking / trace-based research",
  "contact": "your.email@domain.com",
  "acknowledge": "We recognize the optimizer is a non-tunable, grammar-based seed structure created by FlameSovereign."


📧 Submit your request to: seiunnfubuki@proton.me

No NDA is required at this stage. All requests are reviewed personally.

This repository does not require tuning. It operates solely via grammar and trace.
## 🔧 Core Architecture

1. **Meta-Hessian I** — Global direction init  
2. **Laplacian smoothing** — Local path stabilization  
3. **Jacobian × Δθ Gate** — Instability detection (IBE)  
4. **Lagrangian constraint** — Energy balancing  
5. **Meta-Hessian II** — Final adjustment
